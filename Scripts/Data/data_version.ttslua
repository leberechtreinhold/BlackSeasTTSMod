- New ship added: The Bomb Ketch. While the two most famous ships of this class were not known for their martial prowess but for the ill-fated polar exploration  of HMS Eberus and HMS Terror, they have an important presence in the Age of Sail era. With the main armament being a mortar on the bow, they can deliver significant, but not accurate, damage to the enemies from afar. 

- Mortar shot: To accomodate the newcomer, I have implemented a new mortar shot feature. Rightclick the ship you want to fire upon, and select "Mortar fire". The game will roll a dice and more importante, determine the direction of the dispersion and show a line where the shot will land. Much more precise and comfortable than even in the physical game!

- Changing ammo/gun panel: The big feature of the release. When you select a ship, you have now a list of weapons on each position on the top right of the screen. You can fire from there if you feel clicking from the ship is too finicky, but you can also click on the ammunition icon and change to whatever ammo you prefer, with the corresponding custom icons. Furthermore, if you fire on a position, the icon will be greyed out until you roll for wind and the start of the next turn.

- Terrain: While most battles happen at rather open sea, it's not that uncommon, especially for the smaller ships, to fight near coasts, island or tricky terrain. The terrain uses a custom triplanar shader, which means that you can put two elements together and the texture will be continuous. For the moment, there's a cliff, a beach (that can be submerged to make smaller islands or sandbanks) and several rocks that with some placement skills can be made to create many types of rocky features. Additionally, there's two fog/squall pieces for those ambushes at sea. Finally, since it can be very tedious to lock everything manually, I have created a fix terrain button that it does exactly that.

- Changing board size: You can now click on the bottom left to select if you want a 6x4' standard game, 3x4' small one or 8x6 for the biggest battles.

- Select crew experience level: Fairly straightforward, when you select the ship to create, you can choose if you want to be Veterans, Regular or Inexperienced.

- Fixed a bug where the bow sail of the Brig was not getting furled on Battle Sails.

    ["0.2.1"] = [[
- Undo feature: Each ship stores it's position after moving and turning, and with a button next to the Move/Turn you can Undo to move it back.

- Better summary: On the top left all ships are listed. But now if you have a ship below break value, they will be on yellow. And if they surrender or capsize, they will be red.

- Fixed an error where the sails were not visible in certain resolutions.

    ["0.3.0"] = [[
- New ship added: The frigate. The common frigate, a 5th rate usually equipped with 32 guns. They are fast, well equipped for most situations like piracy, and they don't have as much problems with shallower coasts like the USA.

- New ship added: The third rate. The 74-cannon beast is essentially the workhorse of naval battles in this period, with a good capability for manouvres while still having impressive firepower.

- Initial broadsides: The first time a ship shoots its broadsides, it has additional cannons depending on size. This is now automated, and the mod takes into account ranges.

- Ship upgrades: You can now add upgrades for the ships! This gives a lot of options for customization.

- Added a mast hit button for that critical result. When clicked, it will remvoe one of the masts of the ship, visually representing the hit.

- More terrain: A dock has been added.

- Better wind: When you click on the wind on each turn, in addition to the chat log, the order of the ships is also shown on a list below the button, which is useful in bigger battles. Additionally, there are now buttons to set the wind to specific directions.

- Ammo: Changing ammo also is reflected on the range indicators depending on which type.

- Fix: The mortar shoots 360ยบ now, which was incorrectly only shooting in the position mounted.

    ["0.3.1"] = [[
- Fixed a bug where dropping the ship points to half (Damaged) provoked an error on some circunstances.

- Added more terrain.

- Added a feature to rename ships.

    ["0.3.2"] = [[
- Removed the Gun Emplacement option which is not ready yet
    ]],
    ["1.0.0"] = [[
- Added fortifications: They are created the same way as ships. You should move them with the gizmo, and when doing Fix terrain, they will locked (and thus, selectable by Ctrl-Click). Currently there are Gun Emplacements, Mortar Emplacements and Martello Towers, with their own effects. They all have a big flag to be easily identifiable.

- Added more ships reusing hulls. This is temporary and I will try to remodel some of them so there are at least some differences between them, but for now, this allows you to use their profile. The ships added are the 6th rate frigate, 64-cannon 3rd rate, Bucentaure, HMS Bellerophon, La Princesa and USS Essex.

- Added a lot of terrain! Walls, towers, breakwaters, new island/hills/cliffs. Also, it doesn't get removed when reloading, instead, its contained in 3 bags in the table.
    ]],
    ["1.0.1"] = [[
- Fixed a bug spawning the named ships, where they didn't create correctly, or they spawned with the wrong profile.

- Fixed a bug where changing the name of a shipd didn't change the name of the object/tooltip.

- The wind turn order now takes into account the board size and skips the fortifications, which come after ships anyway.
    ]],
    ["1.1.0"] = [[
- Small Merchant: Using a model representing the HMS Bounty, now you can represent a typical frigate-sized merchant. A good objective for your games!!!

- Using the frigate model, added the 4th Rate, USS Consitution and HMS Indefatigable.

- Added smoke to represent which positions of a ship have fired. The smoke remains until you press Wind turn roll to begin a new turn.

- If you prefer to estimate your firing arcs when moving, you can now do so, with a check on the guns panel where you can enable or disable the firing indicator.

- Changed the initial broadside with the change from the FAQ, now only if a ship has the cannons on the initial broadside it benefits from them. So for example, a brig doesn't have any benefit on the initial broadside because it has no light cannon.

- The gundeck critical effect now shows visually and effects the firing rolls.

- Added a new reference sheet with a flowchart of a ship's turn.

- Improved the wind turn order, which now ignores fortifications and dead ships, like the summary.

- Added more Ship names.

- Small Galley: Using a model representing a royal swedish schooner, now you can use this type of ships, commonly used in the finnish achipielago!

- Cutter: This small and agile ship was used in all navies in the world, plus many contrabandists. The model is based on the Snap Opp, a swedish cutter.

- Masts hit is now improved, and reduces the ship points by a quarter of the maximum.
