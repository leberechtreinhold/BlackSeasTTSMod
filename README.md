Black Seas TTS Mod


Black Seas is a fast paced wargame created by Warlord games that allows you to recreate battles in the Age of Sail, with fights between 3-6 ships per side in under 2 hours.

This is a mod which will help you help you play most areas of the game, with a bunch of graphical goodies to spice things up.

Features:

- Ship cards: Clicking on each ship will show up a card on the bottom right with all the data from the ship, plus most controls, included automated movement.

- Firing: Each ship when selected will show fire buttons from each arc to fire. Clicking on them, in addition to a fancy particle show, will roll the respective dice, which will be logged. In addition, the ranges and arcs of the weapons will be shown - plus a couple of useful ranges like far range (10") and point blank (3").

- Sail control: From the card you can change the level of sail, which will be represented on the actual ship.

- Damage: Track damage from the card, loweing the weapons automatically when reaching half. You can also set track the critical result status, including fire. You can also surrender. A summary of the ships and their own ship points is also shown on the top left.

- Automated ship creation. Choose between 16 different flags to create your brig automatically. They also get historically correct names!

- Wind management: The flags indicate the wind attitude with the ship, but you also get the exact angle listed and the corresponding maximum sail.
